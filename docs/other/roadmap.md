# Roadmap

// TODO: add roadmap and future plans

## Future roadmap

Due to it's declarative syntax, Gaudi is able to understand the intention behind the code. This in turn enables it to simplify and automate tedious and repetitive code, as well as complex workflows.

##### Examples of possible future workflows

- automatic database query caching and cache invalidation
- zero-downtime database migrations
- automatic REST, GraphQL and live pub/sub interfaces built from a single API specification
- auto-generated documentation, tests
- monitoring your app usage and performance out of the box
- ...

##### Some of design goals

- increase developer productivity
- reduce technical debt and the amount of boilerplate code
- simplify security and data migrations
- offer powerful, fast and simple data querying engine
- simplify integration of client apps with the backend
