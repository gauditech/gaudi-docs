## Introduction

Gaudi is a declarative programming language and a backend development framework that makes it easier to build and maintain web applications.

Some of its design goals include:

- increase the productivity of developers
- reduce technical debt and the amount of boilerplate code
- simplify security and data migrations
- offer powerful, fast and simple data querying engine
- simplify integration of client apps with the backend

### Future roadmap

Due to it's declarative syntax and a domain-specific language features, Gaudi is able to understand the intention behind the code. This in turn enables it to simplify and automate both tedious and repetitive code, as well as complex workflows.

Some examples of such workflows include:

- automatic database query caching and cache invalidation
- zero-downtime database migrations
- automatic GraphQL and live pub/sub interfaces built from API specification
- auto-generated documentation, tests, and more

## Current status

Gaudi is currently in beta. It's just about ready to be used to build applications which interface through REST API endpoints.

## Roadmap
